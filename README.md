### HubPvPPlus is a light weight, customizable plugin designed to enhance the hub experience of Minecraft servers by enabling PvP combat using a special magic sword.
#### Created by **Contact For Hire [JAY GAMERZ](https://www.fiverr.com/jay_gamerz) and [KANAIYA](https://www.youtube.com/@kanhaiyaswagger.)**, this plugin allows players to easily toggle PvP in the lobby or Hub.

# üìú Features

Fully customizable: Modify all messages and options via config.yml.
PvP toggling: Equip the magic sword to enable PvP and unequip it to disable PvP.
Easy setup: Simple to install and configure.
Reloadable configurations: Adjust plugin settings without needing to restart the server.
Supports fun interactions: Allows players to battle in the lobby while maintaining flexibility.

# üöÄ How It Works

Players can equip the magic PvP sword to enable PvP mode.
With the sword equipped, players can fight others who also have PvP enabled.
Once the sword is unequipped, the player‚Äôs PvP mode is disabled, and they can no longer be attacked.
