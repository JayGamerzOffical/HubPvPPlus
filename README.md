# **HubPvPPlus**

### HubPvPPlus is a light weight, customizable plugin designed to enhance the hub experience of Minecraft servers by enabling PvP combat using a special magic sword.
#### Created by **Jay Gamerz** and **Kanaiya**, this plugin allows players to easily toggle PvP in the lobby or Hub.

PvP toggling: Equip the magic sword to enable PvP and unequip it to disable PvP.
Easy setup: Simple to install and configure.
Reloadable configurations: Adjust plugin settings without needing to restart the server.
